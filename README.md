With this Program you can create Employees and manage them.
For example you can change salarys of Employees or promote them etc.
On start you have a selection on what you wanna do, type the number and you get asked bunch of things. For example if you add a new Employee you will get asked what name and what Rank.
After you completed it you get send back to the beginning and can select again by typing the number.
Make sure you save your Employees in a txt file before ending the program.
I will update it when I learn new things in the Helsinki Course, for example:
I wanna add an interface later where you see your Employees in realtime, can click on them and promote them directly from there or change salary etc.
